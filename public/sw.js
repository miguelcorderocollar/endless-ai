/**
 * Service worker: the app shell, nothing else.
 *
 * The quiz is already offline-tolerant without us. `bankCache.ts` persists the
 * drawn page and the published list to localStorage, and `QuizFromConvex`
 * paints that snapshot on a cold start and swallows the draw failure when the
 * network is gone. So the only missing piece to make an installed app launch
 * on a plane is the HTML plus the JS chunks it points at. That is exactly what
 * this file caches, and nothing else.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT touch, because caching it would corrupt the
 * app rather than help it:
 *
 * - Convex (`*.convex.cloud`) and the auth domain. Cross-origin, so it never
 *   reaches a handler. Queries and mutations stay live-or-fail, and the app's
 *   own fallbacks decide what a failure looks like.
 * - RSC payloads (`?_rsc=`). Next's client-side navigation is versioned
 *   against the bundle that requested it. Serving a stale payload breaks the
 *   router in ways that are very hard to debug, so they go to the network.
 * - Anything non-GET, or carrying a `Range` header.
 *
 * Two caching strategies, chosen by what each URL means:
 *
 * - Documents (navigations): network-first with a short timeout. A cached
 *   Next HTML page pins the exact content-hashed chunk names it was built
 *   with, so serving it while online is how you get a white screen after a
 *   deploy. Network-first means you only ever read stale HTML when you are
 *   actually offline, and the chunks it names are the chunks in the cache.
 * - Static assets (content-hashed chunks, images, fonts): cache-first. The
 *   hash in the filename is the cache key, so a hit is always correct.
 *
 * `VERSION` is the cache key. `sw.js` is served from `public/`, so Next does
 * not fingerprint it and a deploy will not retire the old caches on its own.
 * Bump VERSION by hand when the shell needs to be rebuilt from scratch; normal
 * deploys need nothing, because the new SW activates after the old clients
 * close and simply repopulates.
