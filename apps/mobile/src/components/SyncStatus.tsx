 *

 * the app is open: on mount, when the network returns mid-session, and when the
 * auth state settles after a sign-in. It lives in the root layout rather than a
 * screen, which is the one structural difference from the web — a phone moves
 * between four screens and the queue has to survive all of them, where the web
 * mounts a flusher per route. A drain against an empty queue is a no-op, so
