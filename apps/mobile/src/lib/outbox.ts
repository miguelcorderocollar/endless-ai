/**
 * The native answer outbox: the AsyncStorage adapter over the shared core
 * (`src/lib/answers/outboxCore.ts`).
 *
 * The split is deliberate and it is the point. The rules the *server* depends
 * on — order, cap, sanitising, stop-at-first-failure, per-account attribution,
 * `eventId` on every send — are in the core, imported, and the web app drains
 * through the same functions. What differs here is only the two things that
 * genuinely differ between a browser and a phone:
 *
 *   1. **Reads are async.** localStorage is synchronous, so the web adapter can
 *      hand `useSyncExternalStore` a value during render. AsyncStorage cannot,
 *      so the queue is an in-memory mirror that is *seeded once at startup* and
 *      written through on every change. Every mutation goes through `set`,
 *      which is the only place the mirror and the store can diverge, and it
 *      updates both.
 *
 *   2. **There is no cross-tab sync.** One app, one process. The web's
 *      `storage` listener has no native equivalent and needs none — a phone has
 *      one copy of this module.
 *
 * A write failure is swallowed on purpose, same as the web: the answer already
 * painted locally and the rating moved. Losing the queued copy costs a sync,
 * not the answer.
