/**
 * The storage-agnostic half of the answer-event outbox (#17), shared by the
 * web app and the native app (#18).
 *
 * Why the split: the rules that make the outbox correct are not about storage.
 * They are that every send carries an `eventId` the server can dedupe on, that
 * events drain in record order, that the drain stops at the first failure so
 * nothing behind it is skipped, and that events tagged with another account are
 * never sent under this one. Those four are what `convex/answers.ts` relies on,
 * and reimplementing them in `apps/mobile` would have been a second place to get
 * them wrong. They live here, and the two adapters (`outbox.ts` for
 * localStorage, `apps/mobile/src/lib/outbox.ts` for AsyncStorage) only decide
 * where the list is kept and when to notify.
 *
 * Everything in this module is pure and synchronous except `runDrain`, which
 * awaits the transport. That is deliberate: it makes the whole thing testable
 * without a DOM, an emulator, or a WebSocket.
