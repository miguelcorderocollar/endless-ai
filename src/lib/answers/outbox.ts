/**
 * The answer-event outbox (#17): every signed-in answer is queued first and
 * the queue drains first-in-first-out, so the server always sees events in the
 * order the player made them.
 *
 * Why the queue sits in front of even the live path: a mutation that fails is
 * indistinguishable from one whose *response* was lost. Sending "just try it
 * and queue on failure" would insert a duplicate for the second case. Always
 * enqueue-then-drain means every send carries its `eventId`, and the server's
 * exact lookup (`by_user_event`) turns the ambiguous case into a no-op. The
 * 5s network-retry window in `answers.answer` is skipped for these, because a
 * player who answered the same question twice while offline would otherwise
 * lose the second attempt on replay.
 *
 * Guests never enqueue: there is no account for the server to attribute the
 * events to, and a later sign-in deliberately does not backfill them. Queued
 * events carry the signed-in handle they were recorded under, and the drain
 * only sends another account's events for that account — signing out with
 * pending events parks them until that account signs back in, instead of
 * forging another player's history. Untagged events (no handle was known when
 * recorded) drain under whoever is signed in; the server attributes by auth
 * identity regardless.
 *
 * This module is the localStorage adapter. The rules — order, cap, sanitising,
 * stop-at-first-failure, per-account attribution — are in `outboxCore.ts`,
 * shared verbatim with the native app (`apps/mobile/src/lib/outbox.ts`), so
 * the two stores cannot drift on the part the server actually depends on.
