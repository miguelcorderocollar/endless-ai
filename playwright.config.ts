/**
 * E2E runs against a production build, never `next dev`.
 *
 * The app registers a service worker and only in production, so a dev server
 * would leave every install and offline test asserting nothing. It also serves
 * content-hashed chunks, which is what the worker caches. `npm run build` is
 * the webServer command so a stale `.next` cannot quietly pass a test.
 *
 * Chromium only, on purpose: service worker lifecycle, `beforeinstallprompt`
 * and offline emulation are all Chromium-only in Playwright, and those are the
 * tests worth having. Add a firefox/webkit project here when something needs
 * to be proven on more than one engine.
