/**
 * The server half of the offline outbox (#17): `eventId` makes replayed
 * answers idempotent. The client half (`drainOutbox` ordering, stop-on-first-
 * failure) is unit-tested in `src/lib/answers/outbox.test.ts` with a stubbed
 * sender; these specs run the real mutation against an in-memory backend, so
 * the dedupe interaction they pin cannot drift from the deployed code.
 *
 * Three invariants, each load-bearing for Elo/streak/count integrity:
 *
 * 1. Replaying an `eventId` returns the stored result without inserting.
 *    (A mutation that succeeded while its response was lost must not count
 *    twice.)
 * 2. Two same-question, same-verdict answers with *distinct* `eventId`s both
 *    record. (The 5s network-retry window must not eat a genuine second
 *    attempt queued offline.)
 * 3. Two same-question, same-verdict answers *without* `eventId`s record
 *    once. (Old clients keep the legacy retry window.)
